# River_flow_prediction

Welcome to the 'River_flow_prediction' repository!

Event: Kaggle competition for the course Predictive Modeling 
Participant: All MSc Bioinformatics Students of the Ghent University

River flow prediction is essential in many applications of water resources planning and management.
Accurate forecasting of a river's flow can play a significant role in the planning of water projects, irrigation, and hydropower systems, as well as the overall optimization of the available water resources.
As the world starts to feel the effect of climate change, accurate prediction of river flow can provide alerts of imminent floods and improve the utilization of reservoirs during droughts.
Machine learning models that can output multiple values at once (Multi-target prediction) can be a natural way of predicting the river flow at multiple locations simultaneously.
The goal of this competition is to use multivariate regression methods in order to predict the future water flow at 8 different locations at once.
